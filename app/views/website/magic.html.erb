        To get started, think of a number between 1 and 100.

    <%= label_tag "x3", "Divide your number into 3 using only whole numbers*. How much is the remainder? (if there is no remainder enter 0)" %>
    <%= number_field_tag "x3", nil, in: 0...3, size: 2, maxlength: 1, value: 0, data: {x: 3} %><br> 
    <%= label_tag "x5", "Now divide your number into 5 using only whole numbers*.How much is the remainder?" %>
    <%= number_field_tag "x5", nil, in: 0...5, size: 2, maxlength: 1, value: 0, data: {x: 5} %><br>
    <%= label_tag "x7", "Now divide your number into 7 using only whole numbers*.How much is the remainder?" %>
    <%= number_field_tag "x7", nil, in: 0...7, size: 2, maxlength: 1, value: 0, data: {x: 7} %><br>
    <%= submit_tag "Calculate", class: "submit", onclick: "calculate()" %>

    <p>
    *For example: if your number was 10. Dividing into 3 would leave a remainder of 1,<br>dividing into 5 would leave a remainder of 0, and dividing it into 7 would leave a remainder of 3.
